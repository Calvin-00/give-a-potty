                    When I was in elementary school, our toilet was an open pit. No privacy. No dignity. No safety. 
                    I often skipped breakfast to avoid needing to go.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
                    Sometimes, I fought off boys who peeked while my sister used the bathroom. Rain made the pit overflow.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
                    Of course, I dreaded going to school because of these open toilets.

                    Years later while serving in Haiti, I saw hundreds of children suffering the same way. 
                    God put a fire in my heartâ€”and PoopPotty was born.
